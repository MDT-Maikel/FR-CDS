FeynRules Models for Colored Dark Sectors
===========
This is a small package which uses Mathematica and FeynRules to construct models that describe colored dark sectors presented in [arXiv:1703.00452](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00452). See the included Mathematica notebook for more details.

The repository contains the following useful files & folders:
* dmx_fr.nb         - Mathematica notebook that produces the model files.
* dmx.fr            - FeynRules Model file containing all models.
* SM.fr             - Default Standard Model file as shipped with FeynRules.
* dmx/              - UFO output for all models together, use the notebook to produce individual models.
